# Image Mapping

Transform images using arbitrary functions.

## Usage

Note: This is very much a developer tool. There are no options. You may edit the code to change functionality.

- In the directory you are running the tool, create a directory named `output` and place an image named `source.png`.

- Run `cargo run --release`. You may want to always build release for this project due how much computation happens. Debug builds will be significantly slower.
